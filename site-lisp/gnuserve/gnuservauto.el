;;; Commentary:

;; Load gnuserv automatically. Should be used together with the
;; version of gnuserv/gnuclient that you should have received together
;; with this file.
;;
;; Usage: called when you use -s option with gnuclient(w). Note that
;; the following files must be in the same directory:
;;
;; - gnuserv.exe, gnuclient(w).exe, gnuservauto.el, gnuserv.el
